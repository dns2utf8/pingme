    <h1>Ping Me, version 0.0.1</h1>

    <p>This web tool measures the ability of a random Internet-connected node
    to estimate activity on your network link by pinging you. It's a companion
    to the PAM 2018 paper <span class="paper-title">Revisiting the Privacy
    Implications of Two-Way Internet Latency Data</span>, available with
    source data 
    <a class="paper-link"
    href="https://github.com/mami-project/rtt-privacy-paper">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Let's go!</h2>

    <p>Click "start" below the to start the measurement. You can specify an
    alternate content URL; it should be something that takes at least a few
    seconds to download on your connection, though. Read below for details on
    what's happening.</p>

    <div class="tool">

      <div class="output" id="status">The measurement is not running.</div>

      <div class="output" id="result">Results will appear here.</div>

      <div class="controls">

        <form>
          Content: <input type="url" id="content-url"></input>
          <input type="button" onclick="pingMe()" value="Start"></button>
        </form>
      
      </div>

    </div>

    <h2>Why should I run this measurement?</h2>

    <p>As we explain in the <a
    href="https://github.com/mami-project/rtt-privacy-paper">paper</a>, it may
    be possible for a third party in the Internet to determine activity on
    your home network, provided the four following assumptions hold:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Your access link is your bottleneck link.</b> This is the case on
      most residential networks.</li>
      <li><b>Your access link is excessively buffered.</b> Though the
      networking community has known about "bufferbloat" for some time, and
      newer residential equipment is less likely to suffer from it, this is
      still a common occurence. Bufferbloat causes a large variance between
      latency under load and latency when not loaded.</li>
      <li><b>You are the exclusive user of your public IP.</b> This is not the
      case if your ISP uses carrier-grade NAT.</li>
      <li><b>Your access link does not treat ICMP packets
      differently.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This measurement checks whether these assumptions hold by attempting to
    measure load on your link remotely. If the results show a more or less
    straight line, where RTT is independent of load, one or more of the
    assumptions do not hold. Perhaps your access link is behind a
    carrier-grade NAT, or the buffering on your access link is not excessive.
    If the results show a pronounced plateau, with baseline latency
    significantly lower than latency under load, then remote entities may be
    able to estimate load on your link via ping.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    First, the tool downloads the content you chose, to determines how long it
    takes. It then requests a continuous ping for that duration from a remote
    ping service, running on this server, which is independent from the
    content server. This simulates a third party trying to determine load on
    your link. Then it downloads the content a second time to load the link,
    and finally retrieves and displays ping results from the remote ping
    service.

    <h2>What data do we collect, and how do we use it?</h2>

    <p>The record of the ping, including your public IP address, timestamps,
    loss and latency information, are stored on this server. We may use the
    data in aggregate form in future publications or presentations about the
    ability of remote measurement to determine residential network activity,
    about bufferbloat in general, or about related topics. Aggregates will
    never identify individual users; the least aggregated form of published
    data may identify ISPs by BGP autonomous system associated with your IP
    address.</p>

    <p>You can see the raw data we collect by clicking the raw data link after
    the measurement is finished. If you'd like to delete your data after the
    measurement is complete, send this link to <a
    href="mailto:trammell@tik.ee.ethz.ch">trammell@tik.ee.ethz.ch</a>
    requesting deletion.</p>
